Timeserver
Joel Richart

This is a server which provides the local time of the user
as well as gives some login functionality if the authorization
server is also running. It provides information to a monitor
program if it is run.

**This program can only be built and run in linux**
it generates a uuid for login using the uuidgen system command.
